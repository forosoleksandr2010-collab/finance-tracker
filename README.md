# Finance Tracker (C++)

This is my first portfolio project. I am building a console-based application to manage personal finances.

## Goals:
- Learn **Object-Oriented Programming** in C++.
- Work with **File I/O** (saving data to files).
- Practice **Clean Code** principles.

## Features:
- Add daily expenses.
- View total balance.
- Data persistence (saving/loading).
