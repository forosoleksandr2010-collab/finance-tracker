# Finance Tracker (C++)

This is my first portfolio project. I am building a console-based application to manage personal finances.

## Goals:
- Learn **Object-Oriented Programming** in C++.
- Work with **File I/O** (saving data to files).
- Practice **Clean Code** principles.

## Features:
- Add daily expenses.
- View total balance.
- Data persistence (saving/loading).

## How to run
1. Copy the code from `main.cpp`.
2. Use any C++ compiler (like G++ or Visual Studio).
3. Run the executable and follow the menu instructions.

## Technical Skills Used
- **C++ Structures** for data modeling.
- **File Systems (fstream)** for data persistence.
- **Input Validation** and buffer management.
- **Functions** for modular code.
